# Jurassic Knights: Valley — Art & Style

**Single source of truth for art and tone:** `documents/design/art_guide.md`

Use that document for:
- Core visual directives ("Mud, Steel, and Scales"), Helmet Mandate, No Magic visuals
- Asset generation guidelines, pipeline, and reference images
- Tone and writing (Epic, Primal, Grounded)

Reference images live under `reference/style_samples` (repo-relative). Always load the appropriate reference from that folder when generating assets; see `documents/design/asset_prompts.md` for which reference to use per asset type.
