# Jurassic Knights: Valley - World Lore Bible

**The definitive guide to the history, society, geography, and military assets of the Valley.**

---

## 1. The World State

### Core Concept & Tone ("Mud and Iron")
The world is a fusion of **Late WW1 Trench Warfare** and **Medieval Knight Culture**, grounded in gritty reality.
-   **The Conflict**: An endless, stalemated war of attrition in a ruined world.
-   **The Technology**: Bolt-action rifles, gas masks, and heavy artillery exist alongside plate armor, swords, and chivalric codes.
-   **Tone**: Historical war documentary meets epic knightly chronicle. Desaturated, utilitarian, weathered.
-   **The Beasts**: Knights ride dinosaurs (*Triceratops*, *T-Rex*) instead of horses. These are treated as heavy military assets, living tanks, or beasts of burden—not pets.

### History (Brief)
1.  **The Dawn Age**: Humans and dinosaurs evolved together on this continent. Early civilizations tamed beasts alongside horses.
2.  **The First Orders**: Medieval knight orders formed, with dinosaurs serving as heavy cavalry and living war machines.
3.  **The Current Age**: The "Great War" era. A perpetual deadlock of trench warfare, industrialization, and mechanized chivalry.

### Societal Rules & Reality
**The "No Magic" Reality**:
-   **Physics & Will**: No spells or supernatural elements. Everything is biology, technology (WW1 era), or psychology.
-   **Replacements**:
    -   "Buffs" = Radio commands, rallying cries, adrenaline.
    -   "Magic Effects" = Chemical flares, signal whistles.
    -   "Auras" = Polished brass, spotlights, sheer charisma.

**Populations**:
-   **Humans**: The bulk of infantry/labor. Always shielded by masks/helmets (The Helmet Mandate).
-   **Saurians (Anthro)**: Sapient, speaking reptilian humanoids. Serve as equals (officers/soldiers). No masks needed.
-   **Primals (Feral)**: Non-sapient animals. Used as mounts, tanks, or haulers. Treated as military assets.
