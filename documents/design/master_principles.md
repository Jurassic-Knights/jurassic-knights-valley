# Master Architecture Principles — Pointer

**The canonical source for architecture and coding standards is the coding-guide skill:**

- **Cursor:** `.cursor/skills/coding-guide/SKILL.md`
- **Content:** ECS, EventBus, data-driven design, performance (pooling, Quadtree, batching), hot-reload, audit rubric, asset workflow, and changelog.

Use that skill when implementing or reviewing game systems. This file exists only so documents and workflows can reference a stable path; the skill content is the single source of truth.
