Always think step-by-step before you write any code.
Explain your reasoning clearly and in detail before proposing any code changes.
Only after you have fully explained your plan should you output the code.
Never output code without preceding explanation.
Fix root causes, not just the symptom.
Never make fallbacks, throws or skips. If you are making a fallback for edge cases, instead ask the user how they want to handle it.
