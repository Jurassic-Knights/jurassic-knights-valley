# Tech Stack

Use the versions below for dependencies and patterns. Do not suggest conflicting alternatives unless the user asks.

## Build and Runtime

- Build: Vite 7. Language: TypeScript (ES modules), 5.x. Runtime: Browser, Canvas 2D, Web Audio API. Do not use Node-only APIs in game code without a clear path (e.g. build-time or worker).

## Rendering and UI

- Main game: HTML5 Canvas 2D. Do not switch to WebGL/Three unless the project decides to.
- Map editor/tools: Use Pixi.js where applicable; do not introduce another renderer for the same scope.
- Optional: html2canvas for UI capture/debug.

## Testing and Quality

- Use Vitest for new tests. Use ESLint 9 and Prettier; respect existing config; do not add conflicting rules without discussion. Use Husky and lint-staged; keep hooks fast.

## Other

- Node 20+ for dev and CI. npm; use package.json and lockfile as source of truth.

Prefer README and this rule over generic “latest” suggestions.
