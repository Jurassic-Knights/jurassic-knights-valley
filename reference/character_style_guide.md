**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-22  
**Source:** 24 reference characters across 4 sheets

## Core Aesthetic: "Trench Knights"

A fusion of **WW1 military** and **medieval knighthood**. Soldiers are not gleaming fantasy heroes—they are weathered, utilitarian warriors in a gritty dieselpunk-adjacent world where dinosaurs exist.

## The Helmet Mandate (CRITICAL)

| **Kettle Hat + Faceplate** | Brimmed hat with brass/steel visor | Merchant, Ranged Units |
| **Mandalorian-style** | T-visor, angular | Officers, Veterans |
| **Peaked Cap + Visor** | Military officer cap with face plate | High Command |

### Humanizing Elements:
- **Hair flowing from helmet** (red, brown, black, orange)
- **Scarves** wrapped around neck (burgundy, brown, tan)

## Application to Asset Generation

When generating equipment/character assets:

1. **Always reference the metal tier tools** for material accuracy
2. **Maintain the squat proportions** if generating full characters
3. **Include utility elements** (pouches, belts, straps)
4. **Add weathering** (scratches, wear, not pristine)
5. **Burgundy/dark red trim** on cloth edges
6. **Brown leather** for all accessories
7. **Full-face helmet** on any human figure
